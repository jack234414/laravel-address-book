# Laravel Assignment - Address Book Application

## Requirements
Create a very basic address book application using Laravel. The application should show a listing of current address book entries (contacts), as well as having a way to edit existing contacts, create new contacts, and delete contacts. You should use a MySQL database (you will need to create the laravel migrations) and store the following data for a contact:
- Name
- Email
- Phone number
- Date of birth
- Physical address

You should create your own git repository for this project and commit your progress often as you work, to show your process. Please provide the URL to this repository when you are happy to share your progress.

**Optional ideas beyond the minimum requirements:**
- You could use a laravel starter kit (i.e. Laravel jetstream with VueJS - https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/starter-kits)
- You could implement an authentication flow to keep the application secure (tip: laravel jetstream and other starter kits come with this baked in)
- You could use laravel sail for an easier local development environment for PHP and MySQL
- You could utilise Tailwind CSS and TailwindUI for a better aesthetic
